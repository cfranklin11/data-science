## Dengue Info

* Symptoms begin 4-7 days after mosquito bite and last 3-10 days.
* Transmission occurs in 5-day period when virus load is highest, which usually begins a little before the person is symptomatic.
* Once in the mosquito, the virus incubates for 8-12 days before being transmittable.
* The mosquito is infected until it dies days, or weeks, later.
* Epidemics occur when there is a combination of a large mosquito population, a large human population without immunity to one of the four strains of dengue, and opportunity for contact between the two.
